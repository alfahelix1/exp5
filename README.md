Aim
To study the concept of Dictionary in Python and perform various operations such as creation of dictionary, accessing elements, updating key–value pairs, deleting elements, and applying dictionaries to solve basic real-world problems.

Theory
A dictionary in Python is a built-in data structure that stores data in the form of key–value pairs. Each key is unique and is used to access its corresponding value. Dictionaries are mutable, which means their contents can be modified after creation.
Dictionaries do not maintain any specific order and do not support indexing like lists or tuples. Instead, values are accessed using their keys. If duplicate keys are defined in a dictionary, Python keeps only the last assigned value.
Python provides several built-in methods for dictionary manipulation:
get() – to retrieve values using keys
update() – to add or modify elements
pop() – to remove elements
len() – to find the number of key–value pairs
Dictionaries are widely used in applications such as student information systems, product management, login validation, and data storage systems.

Algorithm
Start the program.
Create a dictionary with key–value pairs and display it.
Access values from the dictionary using keys.
Demonstrate that duplicate keys are not allowed in a dictionary.
Find the length of the dictionary using the len() function.
Check the data type of the dictionary using the type() function.
Update existing values or add new elements using the update() method.
Retrieve values safely using the get() method.
Remove a key–value pair using the pop() method.
Apply dictionary concepts to solve simple problems such as:
Updating product prices
Searching student marks
Login validation
Finding the student with highest marks
Stop the program.

Conclusion
Thus, the experiment was successfully performed and the concept of Dictionary in Python was studied. Dictionaries provide an efficient way to store, access, update, and manage data using key–value pairs. They are highly useful in real-world applications where fast data retrieval and flexible data handling are required.
